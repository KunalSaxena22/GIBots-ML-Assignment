## Getting Started

# How to Use the Repository

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the GitHub repository containing the code to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
```

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

After cloning the repository, navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd [repository-name]
```

Before running the code, you need to ensure that you have installed the required libraries. Open the `requirements.txt` file in the repository and note down the libraries listed there.

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Step 3: Run the Code

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the code by executing the Python file in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the Python file containing the code.

## Step 4: Follow the GUI Instructions

After running the code, a window titled "Data Preprocessing and Prediction" will appear. Follow the same instructions provided in the previous documentation for using the Graphical User Interface (GUI):

- Click the "Load and Process Data" button to load and preprocess your data files.
- Click the "Save Submission Data" button to save the submission data to a CSV file.
- Click the "Exit" button to close the application.

```
